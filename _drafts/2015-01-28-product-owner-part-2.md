In <a href="../product-owner">Part 1</a>, we ran through some of the responsibilities of what will help to make a "good" product owner.  The problem is, many organisations and teams may be struggling to have a product owner in place that can give the role the love it needs.

Let's run through some common problems I have seen and some ideas on how we as agile coaches, scrum masters and team members can assist the product owner role.

## The backlog is too thin

It is sprint planning day.  The team walks into the room, and bob the product owner starts asking the team for any stories that surfaced last sprint.  After about 10 minutes, it suddenly becomes clear that there is no backlog, and the product owner is trying to come up with one on the spot.

This is an unusual situation.  Under more healthy circumstances, Bob should be juggling with more stories than what the team can handle.

### Symptoms

Bob could be struggling with a lack of vision on his part; he doesn't know where to start, or what needs to be done to provide value.  This could be because there is not enough collaboration happening with key stakeholders, or customers, or control groups that are representative of the market.

Bob could have the opposite problem; he doesn't know where to start because his vision is so vast.

This could also signal a wider problem in the business, that there is a gap between them and the team, and that it is not clear on how the agile process works.  Usually an organisation is packed with domain experts sitting right there a stones throw away; account managers who know exactly what the customers are screaming for, sales people who know a killer feature that might squash the competition, administration staff that have an idea that could slash business costs in half.  There will be many ideas out there, but there may be a communication gap present, stopping the experts to present them.  Perhaps they don't even know how, or who to discuss them with.

### Fix it!

A backlog should always be at least a sprint of work ahead, so it should be very clear early on that this problem is developing.  Approach the product owner with a view to help; encourage them to collaborate firstly with the most knowledgeable experts in the company, as they should be more easily available.  Teach the product owner some requirements gathering techniques such as wireframing and story boarding.  Sit through the meetings with them to assist the process.  Then we can branch out further to customers, or control groups for example.

Gathering the right data from stakeholders and the market is no easy feat; there are books written on the topic.  The product owner will likely need as much support as they can get here.

Educate the business on the teams agile process.  Run some open workshops to teach them how the team is working, and importantly the correct channel on how to propose features that they think will be valuable.  Encourage them to observe the daily stand up, and to come to product demo's.

Remind the product owner that through all of this, their story selection doesn't have to be the perfect high value, small sized stories right off the bat.  That is the beauty of empiricism; we pick the stories that we think are the best ones at the time, then inspect, adapt and improve.  It doesn't have to be perfect right away.

In time, as the product develops and people actually see it start to form, the idea's and the stories should start flooding in.

## The backlog is too big

It is sprint planning day, and bob walks in with his laptop.  He has 647 user stories in a jira board and picks the top 20 to go through with the team.

Why is this a problem?  If a new feature comes in, Bob now has to prioritise it against 647 user stories.  A near impossible feat; there is a good chance that this feature will sit in a back log and not be done for months, if ever.  This is hardly agile!

Another problem, the 647 user stories represent say 30 sprints of work.  This means that the product owner has put effort into writing and cataloguing a huge number of stories that will not be looked at for a long time.  By the time the team is ready to pick up many of these stories, the market may well have changed.  Perhaps the story isn't needed any more?  Who was the key stakeholder that requested it; do they still need it?  Perhaps the client that asked for it has left?  Planning stories too far advance is a lot closer to being waterfall than agile.

> Prefer responding to change over following a plan - Agile Manifesto

Oh yeah, and a plan that far in advance goes against that too.

### Symptom

Quite obviously, the product owner isn't saying "no".  Although such a small word, it can be much harder to say than you think.

When an account manager is begging for a feature or their client will leave, a sales director is yelling down the phone that a feature has to be done because "he has already sold it", when the CEO takes Bob out for coffee and says he wants something done, little Bob feels *pressure*.

It may also be a symptom that Bob has not been empowered enough to truly manage the product backlog himself.  Maybe he *can't* say no.  Managers above him constantly trump him.

### Fix it!

Again Bob needs support here.  He needs to be **empowered** enough to truly manage the backlog himself.  After all, he is the one who has been tasked with being responsible for the product on behalf of the whole company.  Agile coaches, scrum masters, you may need to help educate to make this clear.

Secondly, Bob might need training on how to manage expectations.  When he gets a new feature request, and he feels that the value to cost ratio is not high enough to go into the current backlog, he needs to say it cannot be done.  This might really annoy the business at first, however that is much better than saying yes, and then it going into a IT black hole.  Transparency might hurt in the short term but it is always better in the long run.

Finally, another quote from the agile manifesto:

> Prefer individuals and interactions over processes and tools

How does a backlog get to 647 items in the first place?  Because use of a tool allowed it.  Because there are so many stories, and the product owner couldn't possibly remember them all, there is probably a process that goes along with those them; documentation and wireframes that detail them out.

Now imagine if instead of using a tool like Jira or Trello or TFS or Excel or anything else, Bob used just a simple sheet of card and a felt tip pen to write down the user stories.  Would he ever let the number of stories get to 647?  The stories would cover the hallway!  (OK, I have seen this before, but don't let that detract from this point).

There will be many objections to stick to using a tool.  "We have to track defects", "We need to keep track of progress", "I am a Jira admin and would be without a job if you didn't use it".  I always encourage use of physical cards, and only resort to using a tool at the point that it becomes absolutely necessary, like for a team that might work remotely.  Physical cards help to keep stories well sized, limit how many can be managed at once, and more importantly should be an invitation for a conversation.  They cannot contain essays of annotations or wireframe attachments, good - let's have an interaction instead and get that detail from the horses mouth.

## The Product Owner is hardly available

It's the daily stand up, but Bobs not there.  Instead he comes around an hour later and asks everyone for another update.

The team pick up a new story and want to have a discussion with Bob, but Bobs not there.  They make their best guess and start implementing the story incorrectly, not realising that there has been a last minute update on that story.

A developer has a major realisation half way through a story, and needs to speak to Bob before he can continue, but Bobs not there.  Instead that story moves into blocked, and another story is started.  We now have two half done stories in progress.

A story has been finished, and it has to be demoed to Bob before it can be released, but Bobs not there.  The release gets delayed.

The team have a retrospective, but Bobs not there.  Bob now misses out on a vital part of knowing how the team is functioning, and if there is anything he can do to help.  Sure he can be updated later, but why should he settle for Chinese Whispers when he could have heard the feedback first hand?

### Symptoms

Usually, it is because the product owner is too busy doing his real job.  That's right, the development team is a very expensive resource, the software product maybe critical to the company, and the product owner is responsible for the success of their output, however the company has decided that they won't get a full time product owner.  They get someone from the business and tack on the product owner role instead.

Perhaps the product owner is at too higher level in a company.  Often, people say the product owner should be the key stakeholder.  That is fine, however most times the key stakeholder might be very senior, or is perhaps a customer that is barely in the office, and could not possibly be a part of the team.  Perhaps a director himself wanted to be product owner.

### Fix it!

This is a case of educating the business on the role of the product owner.  If they knew how critical the role was, they would realise they need someone who can fulfil the role properly and be a part of the team.

Sometimes, the product owner role may need to be transferred to someone in the company who can actually be physically colocated with the team.  They may not have the most knowledge of the product, but they know who is and how to get access to them.

This task can be tricky; convincing a business to commit another person full time, or to take the product owner role off a director, that is no easy task.  Perhaps a scrum master could try to measure the cost or impact of an unavailable product owner, and use these to present how it is hindering the development team.

## The Product Owner bosses the team

Bob is in a position where he will naturally want to be pushing for more output from the team.  He has a backlog of user stories, and he is eager to have as much value delivered to the business as possible.  There is nothing wrong with a little bit of a push from the product owner - in fact it can contribute to a healthy tension.  But too much, and it can become a morale destroying problem for the team.

When put under pressure to deliver faster, the team will feel pressured to drop quality.  Skip out some unit tests, or leave their code a bit dirtier than they would like.  Teams will already feel the pressure to do this, they are awarded for delivery after all, so this is a sensitive issue.

Perhaps the product owner maybe overly distracting the team even during the sprint, constantly asking for status updates or questioning the team as they work.  They might even try to introduce new stories, or to stretch out stories that are already in progress a little.

### Symptoms

This is an indicator that there is an unhealthy tension in the team; whether the tension is the chicken or the egg is beside the point; it exists now.  The unhealthy tension exists between the product owner and the rest of the team.  Rather than feeling like they are all in the same boat, and that they are all one team, it feels like the product owner is on one side, and the team on the other, with the team feeling under pressure and the product owner as a demanding project manager or boss.

Maybe, the product owner *is* the boss.  Having a line manager as a product owner is not a great situation to be in; it is too easy for the product owner to start putting an unhealthy pressure on the team to bend to his or her will.  When the team feel pressure, quality will drop.  A drop in quality will lead to mounting technical debt that will bring exponential pain later on.

### Fix it!

There is nothing wrong for the product owner to share with the team what they are going through, and what their hopes for delivery are.  This needs to be kept in check though; the balance between speed and quality is a fine line for a team to walk down.  The product owner needs to be made aware of the risks of pushing the team too hard.  This is particularly the case when the product owner is the boss.

If the product owner is being disruptive during a sprint, then it maybe something that the whole team needs to work on.  The product owner needs to attend the daily stand up.  The team need to ensure they give concise, informative updates on their progress towards the goal.  The team also need to make sure they have huddles and conversations with the product owner as questions come up, or features are ready to be demoed.  If the product owner feels that this won't happen unless they regularly check on the team, then the disruptions will continue.

Finally, the product owner will need to be educated on agile principles, and learn to trust that a self managing team will work more effectively without being micro managed.  The product owner needs to stick to their job of steering the direction of the product, and leave the delivery of the actual product to the team.


## The user stories are too big!

I thought that was just a myth you say?  Think about it this way - a sprint, or an iteration, is like a game of Tetris.  The Tetris board represents the limited time that a team will have, and the pieces can represent the user stories.  Imagine if in a game of Tetris, all of the blocks that fell from the top were just 1 block pieces.  The game would be too easy; filling the board up efficiently with little waste would be a breeze.  But as the Tetris blocks get bigger - say they start coming out as 10 block pieces, well filling the board efficiently becomes challenging if not impossible.

It is the same with user stories.  Nice small stories that can be done in a day or two are great for the team to work with efficiently on, and plan for.  As the stories get larger though, and they start taking multiple days or even weeks, well this makes it almost impossible to plan for.  Certain people get stuck on the story, it becomes difficult to test, changes may start overlapping and impacting other stories, the list goes on.

### Symptoms

Simple really: the team is missing an important meeting called refinement.  It is natural that the product owner will get feature requests as epics, or "very large stories".  But these large, "coarse grained" stories need to be refined so that they are ready for the team to work on.

### Fix it!

As these large, coarse grained stories stories move closer to the top of the backlog, and closer to being worked on, some work needs to be done on them.  The stories will need to be broken into smaller stories, have acceptance criteria added to them, be sized, and prioritised.  This type of work is typically done with the team in refinement sessions.

We would typically run a refinement session for an hour each sprint, so we had a nice backlog of "fine grained" stories for sprint planning.

The product owner, and the team, may also need some coaching on how to write good stories that abide by the INVEST principles.  More to come on this later.

## Summary

There are a number of different problems that product owners may have; this post has run through only a few of them.  No one ever said the job is easy!  But with the right level of support from the team, the agile coaches and scrum masters, we can always try to move towards having a more effective, better functioning product owner on the team.
