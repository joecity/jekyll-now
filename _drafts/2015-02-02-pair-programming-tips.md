## How to pair program effectively

In the <a href="../pair-programming">Everybody Hates Pair Programming</a> post we ran through some of the key benefits of pair programming, and now we want to try it.  Like everything, there are patterns to maximise success for pair programming.  Let's run through some now.

### One driver, one co-pilot

In my experience, pair programming has worked at its most effective when one developer is the driver with the keyboard and mouse, and the other developer is observing as the copilot.

As the driver, you have the obvious job of writing the code.  At first you will feel self concious and slow - but this feeling will go.  Try to talk out loud what your thought processes are so the copilot can follow.  The aim is to keep an open channel of communication and collaboration as you code.

As the copilot, you want to stay focused on what the driver is typing out.  Resist the urge to take over the keyboard.  Your job is to look out for any mistakes, and think about the bigger picture of how this will integrate in with the rest of the system, if the design could be improved, if the code is clear and understandable, etc.  You want to concentrate on the latter here; think more about the big picture and don't be quick to jump in and correct typo's the moment they are made, that is just annoying.

Another task I sometimes perform as the copilot is to use a tablet to research different solutions or technologies as the questions come up.

### Rotate the Driver Frequently

You get the most benefit from pair programming when both the programmer and the co-pilot are engaged and focused.  As the co-pilot, it can be easy to drift off to never never land and end up clocking high scores in Flappy Birds on your phone.

To counteract this, the co-pilot will be most engaged when they feel that they are about to take over.  Ways of doing this include ping pong pairing where one person writes a test and another person writes the implementation, or a simple 20 minute egg timer.

### Rotate Pairs Frequently

You get the most benefits from pair programming by working with a wide range of different people.  This also maximises the knowledge share.

We need to really encourage people to swap partners often though to get true knowledge share and a cross functional team.

An extreme example, success has been reported with so called promiscuous pairing.  This is where the entire team pair programs, and all of the pairs must swap partners on a timer, say every 1.5 hours.  Interestingly, it is the most experienced developer that must move on.

### Works best with complex code

Pairing when designing new, or complex code has a lot of benefits.  Sometimes though, as developers we will always have boring scaffolding code that we have to write.  Sometimes I would sit down for the day and see the next 500 lines of simple code that I had to write.

Tasks like this can be monotonous when pairing, and may enjoy fewer benefits from it.

### Don't force the issue

True to any agile team, we should let the teams self manage and not force any rules on them.  Rather than force them to have to pair all the time, let the developers try it first and then decide when they want to pair program.

They may not want to pair 100% of the time, as the required focus is exhausting.  They may not want to pair on very simple tasks; then again they may want to.

Pair programming may need a slight kick start at the beginning, but whether it sticks and when it should be done is ultimately a team decision.

### Workstation set up

Having a pair programming friendly workstation can help a lot.  Have two monitors, two keyboards and two mice.  Mouses?  Two chairs would be great, and a flat desk that allows the developers to comfortably to sit together.  Remember when you are the driver - you own the keyboard, so have it in front of you rather than twisting and contorting uncomfortably.

### Experience levels don't matter

A common question, is it best for a senior to pair with a junior, or for both developers to be at the same level?

In my experience, it is most productive when both developers are at a similar level.  This keeps both developers engaged and offers more opportunity for innovation and creativity.

However - there will be benefits from pairing regardless of the experience levels of the pair.  An expert will impart knowledge with a junior, and a junior will challenge established ways of doing things of a senior.  The key is to keep the pairs evenly balanced, sharing the driver and copilot responsibilities even in this scenario.

### Scrum values: Respect

Having two intelligent, technical developers working side by side can introduce challenges.  Differences in design and opinions will come up with great reasons on both sides.  Remember that when this happens, to do so with respect.  If you want to criticise some ones code, or question their decisions, do so in a way that you would like someone to do that to you.  Don't open with "I don't like that..." or "That's ugly" or "Who taught you how to program, Charlie Sheen?", rather try leading with less confrontational phrases like "Do you think we should..." or "What do you think about..." or "I am interested in trying another way".

Remember to be open to try the other persons suggestion.  Think about it this way, you will learn more if you regularly try other peoples suggestions and ideas.  Sometimes though both people may feel very strongly their own solutions.  In this situation use common sense; if it is a small decision, just pick one.  Flip a coin.

However for more critical decisions, it may call for a time boxed team huddle.  Call the team together, with the two proposal's and their reasons on either side.  Then use simple dot voting where the team picks a solution.  The key here is not to get too hung up; we are agile and empirical after all.  We can always just pick the simplest solution, and inspect and adapt later as we need to.

Finally, before we begin pair programming, or programming in general, it is good to try and get some coding standards in place.  Having a simple team standard for naming conventions, camel casing, etc. is a good idea for any development team.

## Summary

No body likes pair programming it when they hear about it, or even after their first few sessions.

In the true spirit of agile, try it for a few sprints or weeks.  Stick with it, try it, keep it fun.  Give promiscuous pairing a try.  And after the team has tried it, let them decide how they think they operate the most effectively.

It is no guarantee, but from what I have seen, after most developers have tried pair programming, after a few weeks when it really clicks they end up loving it and don't want to work any other way.
