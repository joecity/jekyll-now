## How to pair program effectively

In the <a href="../pair-programming">Everybody Hates Pair Programming</a> post we ran through some of the key benefits of pair programming, and now we want to try it.  Like everything, there are patterns to maximise success for pair programming.  Let's run through some now.

Before we begin, I make the baseline assumption that when pair programming, one developer is the driver with the keyboard and mouse, and the other developer is observing as the copilot.

### Rotate the Driver Frequently

You get the most benefit from pair programming when both the programmer and the co-pilot are engaged and focused.  As the co-pilot, it can be easy to drift off to never never land and end up playing Flappy Birds on your phone.

To counteract this, the co-pilot will be most engaged when they feel that they are about to take over.  Ways of doing this include ping pong pairing where one person writes a test and another person writes the implementation, or a simple 20 minute egg timer.

### Rotate Pairs Frequently

You get the most benefits from pair programming by working with a wide range of different people.  This also maximises the knowledge share.

We need to really encourage people to swap partners often though to get true knowledge share and a cross functional team.

An extreme example, success has been reported with so called promiscuous pairing.  This is where the entire team pair programs, and all of the pairs must swap partners on a timer, say every 1.5 hours.  Interestingly, it is the most experienced developer that must move on.

### Works best with complex code

Pairing when designing new, or complex code has a lot of benefits.  Sometimes though, as developers we will always have boring scaffolding code that we have to write.  Sometimes I would sit down for the day and see the next 500 lines of simple code that I had to write.

Tasks like this can be monotonous when pairing, and may enjoy fewer benefits from it.

### Don't force the issue

True to any agile team, we should let the teams self manage and not force any rules on them.  Rather than force them to have to pair all the time, let the developers decide when they want to pair program.

They may not want to pair 100% of the time, as the required focus is exhausting.  They may not want to pair on very simple tasks; then again they may want to.

Pair programming may need a slight kick start at the beginning, but whether it sticks is ultimately a team decision.

### Workstation set up

Having a pair programming friendly workstation can help a lot.  Have two monitors, two keyboards and two mice.  Two chairs would be great, and a flat desk that allows the developers to comfortably to sit together.

### Experience levels don't matter

A common question, is it best for a senior to pair with a junior, or for both developers to be at the same level?

In my experience, it is most productive when both developers are at a similar level.  This keeps both developers engaged and offers more opportunity for innovation and creativity.

However - there will be benefits from pairing regardless of the experience levels of the pair.  An expert will mentor and train a junior, and a junior will challenge established ways of doing things of a senior.  So really - encourage everybody to pair with everybody regardless of level.

## Summary

No body likes pair programming it when they hear about it, or even after their first few sessions.

In the true spirit of agile, try it for a few sprints or weeks.  Stick with it, try it, keep it fun.  Give promiscuous pairing a try.  And after the team has tried it, let them decide how they think they operate the most effectively.

It is no guarantee, but from what I have seen, after most developers have tried pair programming, when it clicks they end up loving it and don't want to work any other way.
