I have worked with Software Development for over a decade, in a number of different industries including Finance, Public Relations, Media Monitoring, Government Departments, and Security to name a few.

My roots are as a Software Developer, and my area of expertise and interest lies with both the technical aspects of Software Development, as well as the agile process and mindset that will help companies to foster a successful software development culture.  In this day and age where "every company is a software company", it's never been a better time to try to further the Agile cause.

For the best chance of success, software teams need to be adept at applying the agile process and mindset, as well as having high quality technical practises, from the architecture of their system through to the application of XP practises.  This blog will cover any and all topics towards these goals.
