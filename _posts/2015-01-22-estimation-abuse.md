There is an insidious little problem out there that I have seen almost everywhere to varying degrees.  It starts small; little things here and there, but can rapidly spiral out of control into a full blown abusive relationship.  I want to write about this to help break the cycle now!

I am talking about Estimation Abuse.  What does this mean?  This is the misuse and abuse of the humble story point estimations, and can range from just small grievances to huge developer soul destroying monstrosities.

## What are Story Point Estimations

Without getting too side tracked, Story Points are just one method a team may use to help give an indication of what they think the size and relative effort of their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story" target="_blank">User Stories</a> might be.  These points usually go in a Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8) to show that as the estimates of User Stories to larger, there is more uncertainty about the exact size of that story.

Teams may use any measure to indicate story sizes; T-Shirt sizes, story points, dog breeds, or they may choose not to estimate at all.  As it stands at the moment however, many teams do use Story Point estimations on the Fibonacci scale.  And this can open a tiny evil little door.

## Story Points get abused?

Oh yes they do.  Story points can go from a seemingly inconsequential, harmless exercise to a dangerous black hole that threatens the sanity of any team.  Let me give some examples of estimate abuse that has actually happened.

* Managers who ask the team to estimate 6+ months worth of stories.  "Can you estimate these 237 stories so we can calculate when the project will finish?"
* It is dictated that the team must estimate and size their user stories with points
* Teams start being compared based on how many points they complete
* A Dollar per Point formula has been made to calculate cost per story.  "A point roughly takes this much time, time = money, WHAM"
* The bonus salary for the team was based on how many points the team could achieve
* Stakeholders start making demands on how many points a team must complete
* Managers start micro managing and dictating how many points User Stories should be
* The backlog has some kind of "Point Lockdown", where nobody can add any more story points to the backlog as there is no more budget for them

Hopefully you can see the problems with these scenarios above.  Interestingly, many of them sound like a subtle return to the Waterfall ways, where project managers micro manage and everything is planned and determined up front!  The simple story estimation can be like a sneaky back door that allows the dirty old up front ways creep back in.

## The whole point of Story Points

Most of these problems are born out of a complete misuse of Story estimations.  So what are estimations supposed to give us?

### Help the Product Owner prioritise

The Product Owner is the one who is in charge of writing User Stories and then prioritising them for the team.  Knowing about the size of a User Story will help the Product Owner with this task; the smaller, yet higher value User Stories should rise to the top.  Everyone wants a Ferarri - until they see the price tag.  Then they settle for Grandma's old moped instead.

### Estimations can help planning

When teams add an estimation to a story, they have to think about it a bit more.  Stories that are too large and need to be broken down may be identified here.  Also if a team is trying to plan how many stories they forecast they can do, points can help them determine this based on what they have achieved in the past.

### Velocity helps improve predictability

After a while, a team can calculate a velocity.  This is how many points the team can achieve in a certain period of time, on average.  This can help a team become more predictable; they can have some level of confidence to guess what they are capable of outputting.
It can also be useful to see if a team velocity starts to decrease; the team may want to inspect and adapt to try and address a supposed drop in velocity.

## What do we do with Estimates?

You may notice from the list of benefits of estimations, that all of the benefits are for the team.  Also, the potential cost of estimate abuse is much higher than the benefits of having them in the first place.  This has led me to one rule I try to apply:

> Story Estimations are to be used and kept within the team *only*

Story Points were meant to be an abstraction away from time to stop the kinds of abuse we see, however it is clear that Estimation Abuse is still rampantly wide spread.  The only way to stop the abuse is to keep Story Estimations internal to the team only.

When the team wants to communicate what they have completed or what they forecast next, just don't use the (made-up by the team) story point estimations.  List the business features, or goals achieved, or actionable metrics - anything other than points.

## Summary

A lot of time and energy can go into the estimate debate.  Do we estimate, do we not, do we use tasks and hours, do we use points, t-shirt sizes or Chuck Norris fly kicks?  If we keep points in their rightful place - as a tool within the team only, then the debate should not be so strong and the burden not so heavy.  Let the team decide what to do, and in the true spirit of empiricism, try each method.  Try points, try t-shirt sizes, try #noestimates... and let the team decide what works best for them.
