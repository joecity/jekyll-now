## Welcome to the joeagile blog

Its New Years Eve 2014, I am in the great down under you might know as Australia.  People are going mental; the biggest DJ's are playing in the most elite clubs, alcohol is flowing, girl's are teetering on the edge of a night of regret, guys are teetering on the edge of conciousness, hipsters are teetering on almost looking like they're having fun.  I am thinking about Software.

Its not that I don't like nights of regret or hipsters having fun, but I was thinking about the year ahead and what goal I should set for myself.  Each year I have set something new.  Move from Delphi to .Net *check*, delve into XP *check*, learn about agile process and become a scrum master *check*, focus more on software architecture and SOA *check*, start consulting *check*.

Then it hit me.  I have learnt so much from the community, it is time for me to give something back.  I will write a blog about agile software development.  

## How will this blog be different?

I have noticed most blogs concentrate on either being very technical coding tutorials, or being focused on agile process, mindset, being a change agent.

I believe that to be successful, you need to combine both.  Agile process and mindset is important; how to educate and align the business, how to overcome blockers to agile, discussions on estimates and productivity are all key.  But equally as important is a good focus on technical practises; how to architect an agile software system, the "is TDD dead" debate, continuous integration and delivery.  Both aspects are dependant on each other and crucial for a successful Software Development strategy.

Stay tuned - more on Agile Software Development to come!
